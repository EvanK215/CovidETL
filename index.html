                        <p>Since Covid-19 came to the US in early 2020, the New York Times ("NYT") has been tracking
                            data
                            related to cases and deaths at the county level. For this project, we wanted to integrate
                            these findings with data from the US Census to provide data analysts a resource for
                            confirmed case and death numbers at the state and local level, as well as the impact of
                            estimated mask-usage on cases and deaths in a given population.</p>
                        <p>Our database can be used to find data from the state or county level. It contains information
                            about the number of cases and the number of deaths, and can be controlled for population
                            using the estimated 2019 US Census Data. The estimated mask-usage data can be used to
                            predict the effect of mask-usage at the state or county level. </p>
                        <h3>Potential Questions for Analysis:</h3>
                        <ul>Is there a correlation between mask-usage and the number of cases by county?</ul>
                        <ul>Is there a correlation between mask-usage and the number of deaths by county?</ul>
                        <ul>Is there a correlation between mask-usage and the number of cases by state?</ul>
                        <ul>Is there a correlation between mask-usage and the number of deaths by state?</ul>
                        <ul>How many cases are there per 100,000 people by county?</ul>
                        <ul>How many cases are there per 100,000 people by state?</ul>

                        <h3>Limitation of Mask-Usage Data</h3>
                        <p>The survey that was performed to determine the estimated mask-usage
                            numbers was performed from July 2- July 14 in 2020 with approximately 250,000 respondents.
                            The ability to extrapolate from these numbers is therefore limited based on the time period.
                            Data presented includes numbers only from July 14 onward. To read the NYT documentation on
